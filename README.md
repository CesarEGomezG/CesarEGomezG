# Hi there. I'm Cesar Gomez ðŸ‘‹

## About me
As a professional, I'm a Full Stack JavaScript Developer passionate about creating software products that help the world progress. I have used frameworks like React.js, and Next.js on the front end and Node.js, Express.js, Prisma, GraphQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL on the back end. I also have used React Native and TypeScript to create a mobile app that works both in Android and iOS.

As a person, I like to work in startups because I like being challenged, constantly learning new things, innovate walking not traveled roads, and if there isn't a road draw one and then follow it.

## Projects I have worked on
There are two categories: university projects that I have worked on teams, and personal projects that I have worked on and have been developed entirely by me.

### University projects

#### Academy

#### Park

### Personal projects
