# Hi there. I'm Cesar Gomez ðŸ‘‹

## About me
As a professional, I'm a Full Stack JavaScript Developer passionate about creating software products that help the world progress. I have used frameworks like React.js, and Next.js on the front end and Node.js, Express.js, Prisma, GraphQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL on the back end. I also have used React Native and TypeScript to create a mobile app that works both in Android and iOS.

As a person, I like to work in startups because I like being challenged, constantly learning new things, innovating creating new products and features, walk not traveled roads, and if there isn't a road drawing one and then following it to achieve the team and organization objectives in the best way possible.

### Facts about me:
* I have completed more than 20 online courses to learn new technologies that subsequently I applied to the personal and university projects I have worked on. I leave you my Platzi profile where I took those courses: https://platzi.com/p/CesarGomezG/
* Currently I'm working to improve my soft skills. I think they are as important as technical skills. I'm focusing in effective communication and leadership.

## Projects I have worked on
There are two categories: university projects that I have worked on teams, and personal projects that I have worked on and have been developed entirely by me.

### University projects

#### Academy
My team and I made a web application that organized all the learning resources a company had for its employees. They have a lot of learning resources in many areas and different specializations, but they were disorganized and the employees didn't know how to find specifically which they need to learn in a specific role and moment. We made the app Academy (also called Building Liners) to give this company a place where it was able to had all this contents and learning resources well organized to facilitate its employees to find what they need.
