# Hi there. I'm Cesar Gomez ðŸ‘‹

## About me
As a professional, I'm a Full Stack JavaScript Developer passionate about creating software products that help the world progress. I have used frameworks like React.js, and Next.js on the front end and Node.js, Express.js, Prisma, GraphQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL on the back end. I also have used React Native and TypeScript to create a mobile app that works both in Android and iOS.

As a person, I like to work in startups because I like being challenged, constantly learning new things, innovating creating new products and features, walk not traveled roads, and if there isn't a road drawing one and then following it to achieve the team and organization objectives in the best way possible.

### Facts about me:
* I have completed more than 20 online courses to learn new technologies that subsequently I applied to the personal and university projects I have worked on. I leave you my Platzi profile where I took those courses: https://platzi.com/p/CesarGomezG/
* Currently I'm working to improve my soft skills. I think they are as important as technical skills. I'm focusing in effective communication and leadership.

## Projects I have worked on
There are two categories: university projects that I have worked on teams, and personal projects that I have worked on and have been developed entirely by me.

### University projects

#### Academy
My team and I made a web application that organized all the learning resources a company had for its employees. They have a lot of learning resources in many areas and different specializations, but they were disorganized and the employees didn't know how to find specifically what they need to learn in a specific role and moment. We made the app Academy (also called Building Liners) to give this company a place where it was able to have all this content and learning resources well organized to facilitate its employees to find what they need.

My role was a combination between Full Stack Developer and Product Manager. I helped my team to clarify what we were going to create as a project and I also helped to develop some features of the system: showing all the information on the main page, creating, modifying, and deleting learning paths routes, adding learning paths routes into categories, and deploying the app with Vercel. I made as much React.js components as Express.js API endpoints, and this was the first time I designed and wrote unit tests and end to end tests with Jest and Cypress.

### Personal projects

#### Adventure

This is my more recent and ambitious project so long. It consists in three aplications: a Mobile App made with React Native, a Web App made with Next.js and API made with Express, all of these are connected to each other and was write with TypeScript. In addition I designed all the App interfaces by myself with Figma before start coding the project.

The main application is the Mobile App, and it consists in an educative app made for elementary school kids where they could find educative and entretaining content and then answer dynamic quizzes to earn points.
The Web App was planned to be used only by the people who create and manage the content of the app. If you authenticate yourself as some of these people, you could create, modifiy and delete all the courses, lessons, contents and quizzes that there are in the Mobile App. 
The API contains all the endpoints the Mobile App and the Web App interact with, and also save metrics of how the users interact with the Mobile App. With this project I learned how to use TypeScript and an ORM like Prisma.

#### Read

This project consisted of making a web app quite similar to YouTube as a concept but with readings instead of videos. Read is practically a "YouTube of readings". It has a main page, a page for a reading, a blog page, login and sing up, and I worked in a page where the user could write a reading.

Read was my first personal project and I made it after finishing studying some of the courses I took about web development with JavaScript, both Front end and Back end. It helped me to learn and master those technologies through practice. I also made this project with React.js and Express.js. With this project I also could learn how to create a login, sign up and authentication with JSON Web Tokens to manage permissions in the system with Passport.js and I learned how to use MongoDB, a NoSQL database.
